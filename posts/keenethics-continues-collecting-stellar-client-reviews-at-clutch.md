__Clutch__ is a B2B market research platform, the aim of which is to help businesses make the most successful buying decisions. It has no place for advertisements or paid posts, which would somehow intervene in the process of looking for the best business partner. Instead, the user sees a brief description of the company, its contact information, client ratings and testimonials, concise statistics on the businesses and industries it works with, sample projects, and the services it offers. Clutch lists over 42 thousand agencies. More than that, it offers leaders matrixes in a variety of fields, ranging from SEO agencies through custom software development companies to marketing firms.

__The greatest advantage of Clutch rests in the fact that its ratings and rankings are 100% based on client reviews__. Respectively, a platform user can be sure that the information provided here is objective and fair.

Recently, KeenEthics received five stars from the founder of Ideal Role.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 10px -15px 40px -15px; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">Can you share any information that demonstrates the impact that this project has had on your business?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Keenethics delivered exactly what I hoped for. The chatbot is up and running with excellent functionality. Weâ€™ve gotten positive feedback from test users about how easy it is to use.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">What did you find most impressive about this company?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">As the name suggests, the Keenethics team was quite transparent. They listened and made sure they understood what I was trying to achieve, not just the features I wanted.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">How was project management arranged and how effective was it?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">The team communicated with clarity,  responded quickly, and clarified any questions I had.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">Are there any areas for improvement?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Overall, the project was great. However, it would have been good for them to explain the development stages and timeline in more detail. This would have helped manage my expectations from the start.</p>

Also, KeenEthics received a perfect 5-star review from the CEO of an EdTech company.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; margin: 10px -15px 40px -15px; justify-content: center;">
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">What did you find most impressive about this company?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">They adhered to the deadlines, scope, and cost projections while providing an end product that has been extremely valuable for us.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">Are there any areas for improvement?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Tools for communication could be improved. We found that Hangouts Meet was not a satisfactory tool for us.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">Can you share any outcomes from the project that demonstrate progress or success?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Once we had the clickable prototype in hand, our customers' understanding of our product increased significantly. We were able to help them visualize and conceptualize what it was we were doing for them. Also, since the designer provided components in Figma, our developers were able to quickly implement the designs.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">How effective was the workflow between your team and theirs?</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">The workflow was generally quite effective, we had regular check-in calls, they kept me well informed when there were company holidays, and they were able to respond to our needs in a timely manner.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; padding: 15px; box-sizing: border-box;">
    <h3 style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: 600;">Overall Score.</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0;">Great people to work with, very professional, stayed on track with deadlines, produced a high-quality product!</p>
